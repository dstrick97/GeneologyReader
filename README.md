# GeneologyReader 
## Created for CS 213, Data Structures
This program was created as the final project. A geneology file, cameron.ged was given and using data structures, the file was organized.
Every data structure used was created by me; the standard templates for binary search trees, nodes and lists were not used.
The program reads the file and filters the data, listing the family memebers in alphabetical order. From the same read it then displays the generations, starting with the owner of the file, and showing an ancestral tree.
